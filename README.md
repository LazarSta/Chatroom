# Chatroom
A chatroom application built on Java

This was a final project for a class I took on Java programming for internet.
Throughout this course we covered the basics of java, multithreading and server handling.

The project is packaged using Apache Maven to utilise com.google repositories for json management and building, which is what I utilised to store chat history

# How to run

Open the project folder and run Server.java

It will prompt you with a Server Configuration window and request a port. (I suggest for test purposes you use the "Use Default Port" checkbox)

Upon starting the server, you can now run Client.java which in turn will prompt you with Instance Options, where you can input a Host, Port and Username. (Again, for testing purposes, please use the "default values" checkbox)

Press OK and you should now see a chatroom that stores history locally on your system.
