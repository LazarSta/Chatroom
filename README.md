# Chatroom
A chatroom application built on Java

This was a final project for a class I took on Java programming for internet.
Throughout this course we covered the basics of java, multithreading and server handling.

The project is packaged using Apache Maven to utilise com.google repositories for json management and building, which is what I utilised to store chat history
